# Kurssikartta

## Kurssikartta is my web application project for the University of Helsinki course "Tietokannat ja web-ohjelmointi".

## Technical features
- **Course Reviews**: Users can submit reviews and ratings for courses they have taken, sharing their perspectives on various aspects such as course content and difficulty level.
- **Authentication**: Users can browse courses and reviews without authenticating, but reviews and comments can be posted only if authenticated.
- **Account Types**: There are two different types of user accounts: moderator and regular.
- **Requests**: Regular users can request moderators to add new courses to the platform.

## Purpose
- **Providing Essential Information**: By presenting user-generated reviews and ratings, the platform empowers students to make informed decisions about their academic pursuits and course selections.
- **Addressing Issues with Current Information Sources**: The current source of student-provided course information, such as TKO-Ã¤ly's "fuksiwiki," often contains outdated information, including old courses that are no longer taught. Moreover, the information provided may be undemocratic, likely written by one person only. Kurssikartta aims to address these issues by providing a platform where students can access up-to-date information and multiple opinions from a diverse range of students.
